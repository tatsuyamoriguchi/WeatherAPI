# ABC Coding Challenge
​
Thank you for your interest in working on the **ABC** team! Below is a coding challenge we will use to evaluate your skills and see how well we would work together as a team. Please complete the following requirements, writing code that you would be comfortable submitting to a collaborative enterprise application codebase. The app does not have to have a beautiful UI but must be functional as per the requirements. We will discuss the code with you so be prepared to justify your architectural and stylistic choices.
​
​
# WeatherZip
​
The app will consist of one screen. On this screen, the app will display a zip code (chosen and hard-coded by you), as
well as details of the current weather for that zip code. The details will include:
1. The name of the City for that zip code.
2. The name of the State for that zip code.
3. A general description of the current weather at that zip code provided by the API (e.g. "Sunny, Mild")
4. The current temperature for that zip code.
5. An icon that represents the current weather conditions at that zip code. (e.g. a Sun image)
​
The above data can all be provided by **Weather API**. You will have to [sign up](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) for a free account to use it. You're free to use a different API service if you'd like as long as it can satisfy the above requirements.

Please use native Swift with UIKit and not SwiftUI, as most code our team will be working on cannot use SwiftUI at this time.
